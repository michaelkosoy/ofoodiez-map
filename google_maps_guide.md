# How to Get a Google Maps API Key

1.  **Go to Google Cloud Console**:
    Visit [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account.

2.  **Create a Project**:
    - Click the project dropdown at the top.
    - Click **"New Project"**.
    - Name it "Ofoodiez Map" and click **"Create"**.

3.  **Enable APIs**:
    - In the search bar at the top, type **"Maps JavaScript API"** and select it.
    - Click **"Enable"**.
    - Go back to the search bar, type **"Geocoding API"**, and enable that too.

4.  **Get the API Key**:
    - Open the navigation menu (three lines at top left) -> **"APIs & Services"** -> **"Credentials"**.
    - Click **"+ CREATE CREDENTIALS"** -> **"API key"**.
    - Your key will appear (starts with `AIza...`). **Copy this key.**

5.  **Set up Billing**:
    - Google requires a billing account, but they give you $200 free credit every month (enough for ~28,000 map loads). You likely won't pay anything, but you need to add a card.
    - Go to **"Billing"** in the menu and follow the prompts if asked.

Once you have the key (starts with `AIza...`), paste it here!
